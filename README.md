 # Paper reproduction:
 
 To reproduce the experiments from Section III-A, run the scripts from the folder Recovery from noisy measurements.
 
 To reproduce the experiments from Section III-B, run the scripts from the folder Estimating the density parameter gamma.
 
 To reproduce the experiments from Section III-C, run the scripts from the folder Recovery error as a function of the measurement size.
 
 To reproduce the experiments from Section III-D, run the scripts from the folder Recovery error as a function of SNR.
 
 To reproduce the experiments from Section III-E, run the scripts from the folder Comaprison to an oracle-deconvolution method.
